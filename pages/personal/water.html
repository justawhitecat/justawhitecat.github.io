                    you see all these people drinking plastic bottled water and you just begin to wonder why<br>
                    why would you buy water when you can just drink tap water? and people say "well bottled water has extra minerals"<br>
                    but it also has extra microplastics which makes anything about healthiness pointless because microplastics = bad<br><br>
            
                    but why would you, in your right mind, decide to BUY water???<br>
                    just buy a (NON PLASTIC) water bottle and fill it with tap water and bring that with you<br>
                    it will even be cheaper long term because water bottles really don't cost much and tap water is basically free<br>

                    people say that water tastes "bland" and "flavorless", and for awhile i agreed. but for some reason i completely disagree, there is just
                    something different about water than any other drink that makes it 10x more refreshing.<br><br>
                    i don't know if i am just strange or it has always been the case but water is not that bad. maybe it's just the summer or something
                    i don't know

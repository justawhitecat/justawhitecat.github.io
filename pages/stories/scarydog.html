        <h1>scary dog</h1>
        a beautiful tale<hr>
        so whenever i walk through this place there is this very angry dog right<br>
        he is behind this fence and barks when you go by which is no big deal<br>
        but once i barked at this dog back right and ever since it sounds angrier<br>
        and a couple times i thought he got over the fence so i absolutely sped out the way but luckily he hadn't got over<br><br>

        but anyways for storytelling i will say more about this place:<br>
        so first of all the entrance is near this kind of roundabout at the top of a hill<br>
        there is traffic lights then a little snicket down this area<br>
        it is kind of narrow and is amongst trees and you can kind of see people's backgardens.<br>
        there is the backgarden where the dog is and then you get a kind of small field area which is nice<br><br>

        but yes that is my fabulous story about dog

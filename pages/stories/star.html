        <h1>scary star</h1>
        a spooky tale<br><img src="/images/wall/shut_l.gif"><br>
        so in our RE class when they show presentations there was always this weird star guy that looked really freaky and scared alot of people including teachers
        for some reason.<br>so i decided that i wanted to find it because why not? so basically here it is:<br>
        <img src="/images/gifs/star.gif"><br>
        pretty scary.<br>
        he basically comes from <a href="https://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question26.html">this page</a> that talks about stars<br><br>
        but i did the same thing a year ago and got different results, leading to some random website i can't find now that had lots of different gifs.<br>
        now, i also found an absolute banger on the page i just mentioned and it honestly is better than anything school makes you listen to at gun point<br>
        <audio controls>
            <source src="/sounds/music/sun.mp3">
            What a shame. Your browser doesn't support audio.
        </audio>
        <br>and if you want to know <a href="https://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/solar_system_level1/sun.html">this is the page it comes from</a>, which is also where this background is from<br><br>
        this page is the first time i linked anything not from this website

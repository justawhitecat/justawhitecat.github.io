    <h1>math</h1>
	i wrote this in my maths class<hr>
	so basically i just wrote this entire page about maths and that but then<br>
	i pressed refresh and all my amazing work is now
	gone because i am lacking in the intelligence department.<br>
	so i am going to recreate half an hours work in 10 minutes with max speed.
	<h1>favourite numbers</h1><hr>
	for some reason i have this thing about numbers that are in the 8 times tables, or numbers apart of this:<br>
	1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192<br>
	it brings great satisfaction and i don't know why
	<h1>puzzle</h1><hr>
	   ____<br>
	 _|__|_|_<br>
	|__|__|__|<br>
	this puzzle is impossible. it was made along time ago and it has never been solved because you can't solve it<br>
	i tried to solve it for like two hours then one of my relatives walked in and said "pretty sure that is impossible"<br>
	and that kind of annoyed me because he told me that hours ago before i kept trying so i gave up after about 5 more<br>
	attempts since he told me.<br><br>
	you can get really close but it doesn't even matter how hard you try. keep in mind they designed this puzzle to<br>
	make something very hard.
	<h1>blooket music</h1><hr>
	blooket music is the best music ever like the cafe one is some really good ballroom music so you don't<br>
	absolutely rage and explode after playing such a frustrating game. unless they just felt like<br>
	putting the music there because they could. if that is the case i am confused.<br>
	<h1>apples</h1><hr>
	apples are pretty good fruits like they have a really good taste and lots of different variants<br>
	but the texture is a bit weird and it gets annoying after a bit of eating it. like damn there is alot of<br>
	food in that apple and it takes so long for some reason<br><br><br>
